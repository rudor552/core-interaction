      <p>The Doors were an American rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The original and only members were vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. The name “The Doors” came from a suggestion of Morrison after The Doors of Perception by Aldous Huxley.
        <br><br>
        They were among the most controversial and influential rock bands of the 1960s due to the lyrics and unpredictable stage presence of Jim Morrison, who died in 1971. The remaining band members continued as the three of them until going their separate ways a couple years later in 1973. In 1993, The Doors were inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
