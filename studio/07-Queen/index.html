      <p>Queen is a British rock band that started in 1970 in London, England. The four beginning members of the band were Freddie Mercury on piano and lead vocals, Roger Taylor on drums and vocals, Brian May on lead guitar and vocals, and John Deacon on bass guitar. Hard rock, heavy metal and progressive rock were their original influences, but eventually added more pop rock into their sound.
        <br><br>
        Before the band started, May and Taylor played together in Smile. Mercury was just a fan who encouraged them to explore difference sounds and ultimately joined the two in 1970 and adopting the name “Queen.” 
        In 1977, their album, News of the World, featured two songs that have now become famous anthems at sports games: We Will Rock You and We Are the Champions.
        <br><br>
        They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001 and Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003.
        <br><br>
        Before I even know who Queen was, I knew so many of their songs somehow and when I found out who they were it allowed me to further my interest in their wide range of different songs.</p>
