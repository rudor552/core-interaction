        <h1>Theme</h1>
        <p>My theme is on <code>kinetic/experiential typography</code> as well as its
          presence and relationship to ads in the music industry, such as
          concert posters. Specifically the various ways type and color play
          a major role in the overall design and message the work conveys.
