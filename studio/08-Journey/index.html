      <p>Journey is an American rock band that began in 1973 in San Francisco, California. It was formed of former members from Santana and Frumious Bandersnatch. The strongest and most commercially successful phase of the band was between the years of 1978 and 1987. Within that period of time, Journey released many hit songs. In 2009, one of which, Don’t Stop Believin’, became the top-selling song in iTunes history that was not released during the 21st century.
        <br><br>
        Their sales have produced two gold albums, eight multi-platinum albums and two diamond albums. In addition to that success, they have had eighteen Top 40 Singles in the US where six of them has reached the Top 10 in the US and two have reached #1.
        <br><br>
        Don’t Stop Believin’ is probably one of the most classic karaoke songs to sing, even more so since it was performed on Glee.
