      <p> The Rolling Stones are an English rock band started in 1962 in London, England. The six main members from the start were Mick Jagger (lead vocals), Brian Jones (guitar, harmonica), Keith Richards (backup vocals, guitar), Charlie Watts (drums), Bill Wyman (bass) and Ian Stewart (piano). Only three of the first members are still touring today: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Charlie Watts, plus Ronnie Wood who joined in 1975.
        <br><br>
        They identified well with the rebellious youth during the British Invasion of bands that became popular in the US in 1964. With a mix of early rock and roll as well as the blues, they continued to stay with those roots while maintaining a modern rock sound of the time.
        <br><br>
        In 1989, The Rolling Stones were initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and in 2004, the UK Music Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone magazine has also ranked them as #4 on “100 Greatest Artists of All Time.” They’ve released 30 studio albums and their estimated record sales have exceeded 250 million. 2012 was The Rolling Stones 50th anniversary.
        <br><br>
        The Rolling Stones, to me, is similar to The Beatles in the way that their name will live on through generations. Even if the next one doesn’t know the music at first, their name and credibility as artists will not be forgotten.
