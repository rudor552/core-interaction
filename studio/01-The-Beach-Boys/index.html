      <p> The Beach Boys started as a garage band in Hawthorne, California in 1961. They are one of the most influential bands in the generation of rock set apart by their early surf songs and great harmonies. Their use of inspiration from 1950s rock, jazz groups and black R&B, is what help set them apart.
          <br><br>
          In 1963 they released a series of top-of-the-chart records following a SoCal vibe of the ‘youth culture of surfing, cars and romance.’ This ultimately tagged The Beach Boys with the “California Sound.” Over the years they steered in a different direction with their sound and steered away from just the beach vibes harmony.
          <br><br>
          They had over 80 songs internationally on chart and 36 of them were US Top 40 hits, which is more than any other American rock band. Four of those actually reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They have sold 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. In 2004, The Beach Boys were listed as #12 in Rolling Stone magazine’s "100 Greatest Artists of All Time.”
          <br><br>
          Their music has always been fun and beach or feel-good music. Full House features them multiple times and has used their song, Forever, as a major anthem sung by John Stamos’ character. I only recently realized it was a Beach Boys song all along.
